# Partners

## Java Capital
My first foray into angel investing was through Java Capital. One of the co-founders is my close friend of 2 decades and counting. Vinod and I shared many ideas of the future. Esp India's future (That's my home country and where I grew up and spent 20 years of my life in)!

By starting a VC firm I saw him realizing the dream of funding the next generation innovation in the fields of EdTech, HealthTech, Logistics/Transport, DeepTech, AI, SpaceTech etc.

See their [page]({{ site.investments.partners.javacapital }}) for more.

## Portfolia
My first US based firm but more importantly, a firm that aligns with my thesis and passion - women-founded, inclusivity and sustainability focussed.

See their [page]({{ site.investments.partners.portfolia }}) for more.
