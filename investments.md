## Syndicate

![Chaanakya](docs/images/chanakya.svg)

{{ site.investments.syndicate_name }} is a syndicate that aims to invest in early stage companies (often seeking seed/angel round money) in the above mentioned spaces. We care as much for promise and stellar performance as for underdogs and unsung heroes who have the fire in their bellies to succeed!

Currently we operate using the platform of AngelList Invest. If you want to make a positive difference to our world, come! Back us here - [{{ site.investments.syndicate_name }}]({{ site.investments.syndicate_url }})
