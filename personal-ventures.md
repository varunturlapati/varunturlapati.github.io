# General Note

There is an overlap between my investment thesis and personal efforts/ventures. That way, I find alignment in my efforts and my energy is channeled well. The intention is to succeed, but very importantly learn and adapt.

## Regenerative project

I am working on setting up a R&D/educational prototype project on a piece of land in Arizona. I am working with consultants in the field, with whom, I brainstorm ideas. These ideas will lead to some concrete implementation efforts.

Themes: Regenerative farming, permaculture, circular economy, clean energy, sustainability
Reach out to me if you are piqued!

## Personal investments

I am working with a friend who has a mission to educate and provide jobs to the less fortunate folks, enabling them to step up their path to being financially secure. In what I see a win-win, I want to invite friends and family to invest with me. Outside of the simple win of money, the investments enable lives and financial stability in demographics that lack such stability. For me, it enables a path towards bigger ventures by establishing a track record and business creditworthiness.

Even though this is tentative and the numbers may change, it help to get a visual of what your monetary win may be.
